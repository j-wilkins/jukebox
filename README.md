= Jukebox

a stupid simple app that uses Sproutcore, HTML 5 audio tags, and Pusher.com for WebSockets to play music and let people chat about it.

I make no claims that it will function in any way, that the code is written well or anything else. 

This is mostly a playground for me to play with the above technologies.
